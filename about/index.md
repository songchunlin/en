## Who I Am

My name is Chunlin Song (Chinese character "宋春林", means spring forest), which pronounced like *Troon Linn Soong*. I was born in a small viliage in south Shannxi  Province, China, 1989. I am currently a PhD Student at the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. 


## My Hobby 

In my spare time I enjoy running, hiking, reading and watching sci-fi movies. I am interested in all kinds of electronic products. I enjoy reading science and technology news online. As a graduate student majored in geography, I have travelled many places in China, mostly in western China. But I want to go to more places such as the Antarctica, the North Pole, or even the Mars.
