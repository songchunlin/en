## Who I Am

My name is Chunlin Song (Chinese character "宋春林", means spring forest), which pronounced like *Tren-lean Soong*. I was born in a small viliage in south Shannxi  Province, China. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. My work intended to elucidate how hydrological processes impact riverine carbon transport among different scales. I am also interested in green house gas emissions from water surface and I want to know the green house gas emissions of rivers and lakes in the degrading permafrost region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. I always have a strong drive to learn new things and enthusiasm about earth sciences. I'm a self-motivated person and delighted to solve problems.

## My Hobby 

In my spare time, I enjoy writing, reading, running, hiking, playing badminton and watching sci-fi movies as well as reading science and technology news. I'm learning photography currently. I'm also interested in all kinds of electronic products, especially that created by Apple. As a graduate student majored in geography, I have travelled many places in China, mostly in western China. But I want to go to more places such as Antarctica, the North Pole, or even the Mars in the future.
