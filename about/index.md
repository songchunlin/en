## Who I Am? 

I am a fourth-year PhD student at
[Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn "Zhejiang University"),
China. By far, most of my research focused on animals, especially the
birds. When I was a master student, I initialed the researches of
monitoring animals using camera traps in [Gutianshan
Reserve](/links/gutianshan-reserve/ "Gutianshan National Nature Reserve"),
China. Camera trapping is a new available method to estimate animal
population, especially for some elusive and cryptic animals. I also
participated another parallel project of our group in the [Thousand
Island Lake](/links/thousand-island-lake/ "Thousand Island Lake") (TIL),
China, which is a large inundated lake with more than one thousand
islands. It is a good land-bridge research system to explore species
distributions and test the traditional theory of island biogeography
proposed by MacArthur & Wilson. Now I am processsing these occupancy
data in order to provide more detail into the biodiversity conservation
on fragmented islands.

## My Hobby 

I like reading, traveling and
cycling. One of my important dreams is the long travel from Chengdu to
Lhasa (the capital of Tibet) by bike. I would plan to spend one month to
complete this 2200-km journey. I initialed with this dream eight years
ago when I was an undergraduate, while I am always waiting for the right
time to make my dream come true, because it is a great chance to enjoy
the unique landscape and biodiversity of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. I am
also a
[postcrossser](http://www.postcrossing.com/user/Xingfeng "Postcrossing"),
please [contact me](/contacts) if you have an interest to swap postcards
with me.

## This Website 

I created this website with
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and hosted on
[GitHub](http://github.com/sixf/sixf.github.io). The theme was modified
by [Yihui](http://yihui.name) which was originally derived from [Linghua
Zhang](http://lhzhang.com/) and [Tao Zhang](http://ztpala.com/). I do
appreciate their great contributions so that I can use this elegant
theme directly. When you browse my blog, you could navigate to previous
post by the left-arrow key (`<-`) or next post by right-arrow (`->`). 

If you have any suggestions or find a broken link on this website, please
feel free to email [me](mailto:sixingfeng@gmail.com "Xingfeng's email")
or leave a message [here](/en/guestbook "Guestbook").
