## Who I Am

My name is Chunlin Song (Chinese character "宋春林", means spring forest), which pronounced like *Tren-lean Soong*. I was born in a small viliage in south Shannxi  Province, China. I am currently a PhD Student at the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

I studied Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering in [Sichuan University](http://www.scu.edu.cn/) from 2009 to 2013. After that, I joined [Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment](http://english.imde.cas.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.cas.cn/) and majored in Physical Geography. I found global carbon cycle very interesting during the early time of my graduate life. Riverine carbon transport  is an important component of global carbon cycle and its mechanisms are rarely uncovered. It's hypothesized that hydrological processes play important roles in water chanel carbon transport. So I decided to focus my research work on the relationship of riverine carbon transport and hydrological processes. My research sites include [Qinghai-Tibet Plateau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Plateau) and [Yangtze River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze) upstream. My work intended to elucidate how hydrological processes impact riverine carbon transport among different scales. I am also interested in green house gas emissions from water surface and I want to know the green house gas emissions of rivers and lakes in the degrading permafrost region of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.


## My Hobby 

In my spare time I enjoy running, hiking, playing badminton and watching sci-fi movies as well as reading science and technology news. I'm also interested in all kinds of electronic products, especially that created by Apple. As a graduate student majored in geography, I have travelled many places in China, mostly in western China. But I want to go to more places such as the Antarctica, the North Pole, or even the Mars in the future.
