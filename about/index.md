I am [Xingfeng Si](/ "Xingfeng Si"), a PhD candidate in animal ecology at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn "Zhejiang University"), China. Generally, my research interest lies in island biogeography, community ecology, conservation biology and ornithology. 

I started my researches of bird communities since 2008 on fragmented islands of the [Thousand Island Lake](/links/thousand-island-lake/ "Thousand Islang Lake") (TIL), China. TIL is a large inundated reservoir with 1078 islands which was created in 1959 by the construction of Xin'anjiang Dam. It is a perfect land-bridge system to test the MacArthur & Wilson's theory of island biogeography. I used the long-term counts of breeding bird communities on a set of islands to quantify the colonization-extinction dynamics of the theory, and to test the alternative hypothesizes that "target" and "rescue" effects will lead to different patterns of colonization and extinction. In additions to the bird studies, I used the occupancy data of lizards and small mammals  to unveil the biogeographical patterns of beta diversity, which will provide more detail into the biodiversity conservation on fragmented islands. 

Camera trapping of wildlife, especially for some elusive and cryptic animals, had been practiced and become an available method to estimate the abundance of animals. I started the studies of bird and mammal communities during 2009 - 2012  in [Gutianshan Reserve](/links/gutianshan-reserve/ "Gutianshan Reserve"), China, to estimate the animal population adjusted with detectability using camera traps. Associated with the bird survey using territory mapping in a permanent plot in the reserve, I assess how the environmental factors influence the distribution of bird communities. 

Besides the academic researches, I like reading, traveling and cycling. One of my important dream is the long travel from Chengdu to Lhasa (the capital of Tibet) by bike. I would plan to spend one month to complete this 2200-km journey. I initialed with this dream eight years ago when I was an undergraduate, while I am always waiting for the right time to make my dream come true, because it is a great chance to enjoy the unique landscape and biodiversity of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. I am also a [postcrossser](http://www.postcrossing.com/user/Xingfeng "Postcrossing"), please feel free to [contact me](/contacts) if you have an interest to swap postcards with me.
