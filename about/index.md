## Who Am I

My name is Chunlin Song (Chinese character "宋春林", means spring forest), which pronounced like *Tren-lean Soong*. I was born in a small village in southern Shaanxi  Province, China. I studied Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering in [Sichuan University](http://www.scu.edu.cn/en/){:target="_blank"} from 2009 to 2013. After that, I joined the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ucas.ac.cn/) and received a Ph.D. in Physical Geography in 2019.  I am currently a tenure-track Associate Professor at the State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering, College of Water Resources and Hydropower, Sichuan University. 

My research focus on aquatic biogeochemistry and hydrology and water resources. My research interests include riverine carbon cycle, cryosphere hydrology, water environment, permafrost carbon cycle, and ecohydrology. I am particularly interested in the processes and mechanisms of the transport of terrestrial carbon in cold region waterways under climatic change and water cycle in permafrost impacted watersheds.
