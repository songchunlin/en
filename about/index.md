## Who Am I

My name is Chunlin Song (Chinese character "宋春林", means spring forest), which pronounced like *Tren-lean Soong*. I was born in a small viliage in south Shannxi  Province, China. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate major in Physical Geography at the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I always have a strong drive to learn new things and enthusiasm about earth sciences. I'm a self-motivated person and delighted to solve problems.

## My Hobby 

In my spare time, I enjoy writing, reading, running, hiking, playing badminton and watching sci-fi movies as well as reading science and technology news. I'm learning photography currently. I'm also interested in all kinds of electronic products, especially created by Apple. As a graduate student majored in geography, I have travelled many places in China, mostly in western China. But I want to go to more places such as Antarctica, the North Pole, or even the Mars in the future.
