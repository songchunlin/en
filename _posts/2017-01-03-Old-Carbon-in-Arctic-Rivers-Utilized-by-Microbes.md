The thawing permafrost of the Arctic is releasing old carbon to fluvial systems. But the ancient carbon in the river water was undetectable because of microbes. Researchers found that the old dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is highly biolabile. Microbes can selectively “eat” the old DOC in a very short time.
