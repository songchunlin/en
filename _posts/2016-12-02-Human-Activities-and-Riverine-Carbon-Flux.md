Riverine transported carbon is an important flux for carbon cycle accounting. Both anthropogenic and natural factors will affect the river export of carbon.

Similar results were found in the Yellow River. Wang et al. (2015) used 60 years of runoff and sediment load data from the Yellow River over China’s Loess Plateau (which is the source of nearly 90% of Yellow River’s sediment load). The results show that landscape engineering, terracing, dams and reservoirs trapping, and large-scale vegetation restoration projects significantly reduced the sediment load. Although it is not about the carbon transport, I guess the results have strong implications on carbon flux since the sediments and carbon fluxes in river channel are generally positively correlated with each other. 

Song et al. (2016) analyzed a dataset among Chinese river and concluded that human activities like dam construction and vegetation restoration in recent decades have a greater influence than climate on the transport of riverine carbon across China.
