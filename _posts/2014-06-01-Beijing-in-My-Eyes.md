Last September, I came to Beijing to complete the first three semesters of my graduate learning. So, basically I have lived in Beijing for six months since then. I love this city, and I also hate this city.

Beijing is a super large city with a population of over 20 million. There are people everywhere and long queues everyplace. This leads to a lot of bad experiences in daily life. Every time when I take the subway on workday, I feel my body to be squeezed smaller. Once I get on the train, I can’t move for even an inch since four or five bodies cling to my body. Last National Day I waited the whole night on the Tiananmen Square just to witness next day's flag-raising ceremony. Otherwise I couldn't have had a good spot in the crowds because the ceremony starts in the early morning and there are always tons of people doing the same thing. Thus, too many people become one of the reasons I hate Beijing.

The second reason I hate Beijing is the terrible air quality. Beijing’s air quality goes from bad to worse after the 2008 Olympic Games. The city suffers intense air pollution three or four days every week. Sometimes the choking haze could last for over seven days, making me sick both physically and mentally. Scientists have worked on the air issue but still can't come up with an effective solution. We can do nothing but waiting for winds to blow the haze away. No winds, no fresh air. I hope that the government learn from London which successfully transformed a foggy city into a green one.

Even if there are many disadvantages for living in Beijing, it’s still an attractive place.

As the nation’s educational center, Beijing has many opportunities to be in touch with excellent educational and academic resources. Some of them are world-class. For example, there are dozens of Nobel laureates give lectures in Beijing for last six months. Such treatment can’t happen in cities like Chengdu or Xi'an. In Beijing, I can participate in academic conferences very conveniently. Many top universities and research institutions located in Beijing, which provide a lot of learning opportunities. This could help me expanding my horizons.

Beijing is also the cultural center of China, which means it has the best cultural atmosphere around the whole country. Dozens of large museums provide me the opportunity to discover the mystery I interest in. Many outstanding writers, artists, musicians and Intellectuals live here. People from all over the world bring their culture to Beijing, which build up the diverse culture here. Without going abroad, I can see an exhibition from The Louvre or British Museum in the National Museum of China. Without travelling long distances across the continent, I can see excellent dramas or listen to exquisite concerts in the National Center for Preforming Arts. These are the good points of Beijing.

There are advantages and disadvantages for living in Beijing. In my view, these advantages and disadvantages constitute a complete Beijing. It’s not perfect, but this is where I live, study, and work.

Generally speaking, I have had a great time in Beijing for the past six months. I believe Beijing will become a better place.
