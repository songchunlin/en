I enjoy blogging online. That's because I love writing.

I write to think more effectively. Writing helps me think things better. I can think more clearly and logically while I writing down the fragmentation in my mind. When I organize sentences and paragraphs to finish a complete article, the language can think by itself. So I receive a better understanding about my original ideas after I finish a blog post.

I write to learn better. As I stated above, writing blog helps me better thinking. So, I can learn better by composing text. I couldn’t sure if I had grasped the highlights and the nature of what I have learned until I compose them down. I drop a line through my independent thinking, which is a procedure to make me understand thoroughly.

I write to communicate and get acquaintances. The internet combines the minds of human beings together. Blogging is the best way to communicate with the wonderful people all over the world. This efficient way has already worked. I just open [my blog](http://songchunlin.net/cn/){:target="_blank"} for three months, and I have met some wonderful guys. We can share thoughts and learn from each other. Although we have social network services like twitter or facebook, blogging is far more better to know a man which we have never met.

I write to record. Life is short, and our memory is limited. If I write my biography, my aspirations, or my thoughts down, I have had an archive of my whole biography. It’s an invaluable asset. When I am old, I will read these blog posts to recall my young time. On the other hand, the experience, lessons, successes, and failures of mine could be helpful if other people walk the same path as I did. Thusly, they will reach their goals quicker.

I write blog to have fun. Frankly, I have caused a great deal of fun by writing a web log. I feel glad when somebody tells me I write a big part. I feel glad when somebody tells me my posts are helpful. I feel happy when I finished a post and get a better understanding about I write. I feel happy when someone’s comment gives me more valuable information about the theme I write. I feel happy when an official journal selected my articles to print.

That’s why I love writing blog.
