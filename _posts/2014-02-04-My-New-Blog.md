Earlier this year, I found Markdown through Jianshu—an elegant Chinese writing platform. Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax, which is easy to write and read. By using Markdown, I don’t have to click the toolbar to change the format, just mark my text with simply syntax. This is a whole new writing experience, I immerse in my editing without distraction. I love that status.

I heard about Svbtle because it opens up to all a few days ago. As a blog platform, Svbtle’s philosophy is simple, which make both writing and reading comfortable. More importantly, it supports Markdown. Like Jianshu, Svbtle attracts me with its nearly perfect writing experience and minimalist user interface. The only problem is I can’t change the font. But that’s not a big deal.

Within 10 minutes, my first English blog is ready. From today, I write here in English. I hope the GFW be merciful to this beautiful site, or I have to use VPN service. Keep writing English blog is a challenge. I’m going to learn how to write well, especially in scientific way.

By the way, [my Chinese blog](http://songchunlin.net/cn/) will keep updating. I love writing, it makes me feel contentment. Writing skills is essential to every intellectual. I believe it can be acquired by learning and practice. Just like Leo Babauta [says](http://zenhabits.net/write-daily/):

> Writing helps you reflect on your life and changes you’re making. This is incredibly valuable, as often we do things without realizing why, or what effects these things are having on us.
> 
> Writing clarifies your thinking. Thoughts and feelings are nebulous happenings in our mind holes, but writing forces us to crystalize those thoughts and put them in a logical order.
> 
> Writing regularly makes you better at writing. And writing is a powerful skill to be good at in our digital age.
