> Life is Short. Do Z-turn!

"*Sheer egoism*", George Orwell wrote in his famous article *[Why I Write](http://orwell.ru/library/essays/wiw/english/e_wiw)*, "*Desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be remembered after death, to get your own back on the grown-ups who snubbed you in childhood, etc*". Honestly, this is one of my motivations why I plan to blog here. Although I have learned English for more than ten years, writing skill is still my  shortage, comparing with reading and speaking. Now I will push myself to write more in English either on topics related to [my life](http://sixf.org/en/about) or [my research](http://sixf.org/en/vitae). And hopefully, I can benefit from blogging which might be helpful in my future career. 

I might be a later bird to start blogging online, but I still wish to try it and keep on. Several years ago, I had a dream to build a personal website, now the dream came true. I should work harder and contribute more to this website, which is a recorder of my life and offers me an opportunity to look back what I have done in the past time. 

I taught myself and firstly created this website in the end of 2013 by WordPress, whereas two months later I migrated this website to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) hosted by [GitHub](http://www.github.com). I do not want to waste too much time on maintaining websites and database which is a tedious work. Luckily, GitHub helps me to host all my website's documents and database for free. By far, this is the best choice as I know. With the great service of GitHub and the plain-text writing interface with Jekyll, I decide to stay here as the home of this website in the near future.
